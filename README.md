# Offline Forms

This is a simple proof-of-concept app to demonstrate a few things:

* An [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs) app using pure Stencil Web Components
* [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) (Progressive Web App) functionality
* [Form.io](http://form.io/) integration

## Testing the app

This app is live at: https://offline-forms-527fa.web.app/
